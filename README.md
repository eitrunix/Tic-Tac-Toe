# Tic-Tac-Toe
 Tic-Tac-Toe for Final C++ Project

// First real submission
This is my Tic-Tac-Toe game for my College course, in its current form its a 1v1 game, player 1 is X while player 2 is O

This project mostly was used to show me how to split things into header files and .cpp files and how to merge them without causing bugs/crashes, I still need to add an "AI" of sorts to play against. 

most of this project was taken right out of the project book


//Instructions

Each player will take turns picking spaces on a 3x3 grid, each space is identified by a number(0-8)
Player X will place first
Player O second

play will alternate bewteen the 2 players until one player gets 3 of their pieces in a row.
